Network actuator for blocking ports, IP addresses, etc.
Must have root permissions to run.

To install:
   
   ./setup.sh 


A user can add new rules by running the "netblock" command.

Example: sudo netblock block incoming tcp 80

   - this blocks all incoming TCP traffic on port 80


A program can add new rules by writing to the character
device at "/dev/netblockchar"

Example: Writing "unblock outgoing ipv4 127.0.0.1" to
         the file /dev/netblockchar will unblock all
         outgoing IPv4 traffic from the localhost.
