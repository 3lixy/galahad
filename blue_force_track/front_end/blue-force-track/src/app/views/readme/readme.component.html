  <h1>Welcome to Galahad</h1>
  <p>Galahad is Star Lab's solution to IARPRA's VirtUE program.</p>
  <p>This interface is designed to be a quick way to see the state of the current Galahad system.</p>
  <h2>About Galahad</h2>
  <p>Galahad, a revolutionary user computer environment (UCE) for the Amazon Cloud that is designed to be highly interactive while mitigating legacy and cloud-specific threats. Galahad meets all 11 requirements called out in IARPA-BAA-16-12, addressing the broad areas of threat mitigation, sensing and logging, lifecycle management and control, user interaction, and cost and performance. Unique to the VirtUE program is the requirement that a defensible interactive UCE be built on top of a completely untrusted computing foundation, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p>

  <p>Star Lab's Galahad takes a holistic approach to creating a secure, interactive UCE. Galahad leverages role-based isolation, attack surface minimization practices, operating system (OS) and application hardening techniques, real-time sensing, and maneuver / deception approaches to reduce the risk associated with cloud deployments. Galahad makes no attempt to establish trust, nor does it require specialized, more costly services provided by AWS, e.g., dedicated servers. Instead, Galahad impedes the ability of adversaries to operate within the AWS by making it more difficult to co-locate (either through the use of insiders, compromised hypervisors, witting or unwitting peers, or remote access) with targets, while also requiring adversaries consume more resources. Such an increase in complexity and cost means Galahad also increases the accuracy, rate, and speed with which threats are detected.</p>

  <p>Galahad facilitates the construction, deployment, management, and interfacing of role-based virtues. Star Lab's virtues, consist primarily of two components: Valor, a nested hypervisor and Unity, a virtual machine running a small, hardened, de-privileged Linux operating system (OS). Valor includes protections, sensors, and virtual machine (VM) image authentication, but most importantly it facilitates the regular, recurring live migration of Unity VMs. This moving target defense approach deters hypervisor and peer VM threats within AWS, an operating environment where trust can never be completely established, by limiting the time an adversary has to access targeted virtues while also increasing the number of access points required by the adversary to be successful.</p>

  <p>Unity includes additional protections to address external and insider threats while also incorporating a compatibility layer for supporting legacy Windows applications and adjustable sensors. Limiting Unity to Linux (versus using Linux and Windows) allows Star Lab to more greatly reduce the overall attack surface of the virtue, improve performance, and streamline development. Additionally, executing Windows applications on Linux increases the uncertainty, complexity, and cost to the adversary.</p>

  <p>Sensing and logging take place throughout the Galahad software stack, without requiring modifications to the applications under protection. Within Unity, these introspection points consist of kernel instrumentation, activity monitors, and sensing points added to the compatibility layer. Additional sensing and logging capabilities are layered across Unity and Valor creating tripwires to detect adversary tampering. Overall, a virtue's protections and sensing capabilities are adjustable, updatable, and collaborative, forcing adversaries to navigate a well-covered attack surface to avoid detection. Furthermore, the use of role-based virtues to reduce behavior complexity boosts out-of-band analytics making Galahad a highly defensible construct.</p>
