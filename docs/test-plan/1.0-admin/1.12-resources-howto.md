## Resources How-To

### Test Description
Resources can be attached or detached by an administrator and are available when a virtue is launched.

### Preconditions

Cloudformation has finished running.  A role and virtue has been created and assigned to the user, as described in tests 1.4, 1.6, and 2.2.  This includes creating the firefox123 role and assigning it to user jmitchell. 

### Steps to Test

- Connect to the Excalibur instance
    - Add key `starlab-virtue-te` to your SSH agent
    - Find the public IP for the `Virtue-XX-Excalibur` instance (where `XX` is your stack suffix) 
    - SSH to the Excalibur instance using PuTTY or a command-line SSH connection as the `ubuntu` user using the above SSH key
- On the Excalibur instance, obtain an auth token for the admin CLI:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        
        source set_virtue_environment.sh slapd@virtue.gov Test123!
        
### Create a Resource (Currently limited to file share only)

- Create a file share resource description JSON file via `vim resource.json`:

```json
{
    "type": "DRIVE",
    "credentials": "tgt",
    "unc": "//camelot.virtue.gov/virtue"
}
```
- Create the resource
```
./virtue-admin resource create --resource=resource.json
```

- Attach the resource to a *stopped* virtue:
```
./virtue-admin resource attach --resourceId=<resourceId> --virtueId=<virtueId>
```

- Start the virtue as in test 1.08
  - Verify the file share mount exists in the virtue via `mount`.
  - Verify a `/home/virtue/docs` directory exists in the docker container.
  
- Stop the virtue as in test 1.08

- Detach the resource from the *stopped* virtue:
```
./virtue-admin resource detach --resourceId=<resourceId> --virtueId=<virtueId>
```

- Destroy the resource:
```
./virtue-admin resource destroy --resourceId=<resource>
