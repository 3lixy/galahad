## 1.2 - List Roles

### Test Description

Using the Admin CLI, retrieve a list of roles. What data is provided when we do this?

### Preconditions

- Cloud Formation script has run to completion

### Steps to Test

- Connect to the Excalibur instance
    - Add key `starlab-virtue-te` to your SSH agent
    - Find the public IP for the `Virtue-XX-Excalibur` instance (where `XX` is your stack suffix) 
    - SSH to the Excalibur instance using PuTTY or a command-line SSH connection as the `ubuntu` user using the above SSH key
- On the Excalibur instance, obtain an auth token for the admin CLI:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        source set_virtue_environment.sh jmitchell Test123!

- Use the CLI to list the roles currently in the system:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        ./virtue-admin role list

### Expected Result

In the initial deployed state, the system has a single role called `EmptyRole`. The above CLI command should return:

```
[
    {
        "applicationIds": [],
        "id": "emptyrole",
        "name": "EmptyRole",
        "startingResourceIds": [],
        "startingTransducerIds": [],
        "state": "CREATED",
        "version": "1.0"
    }
]
```

This will return almost immediately.

### Actual Result

Before creating a non-empty role:

```
[
    {
        "applicationIds": [],
        "id": "emptyrole",
        "name": "EmptyRole",
        "startingResourceIds": [],
        "startingTransducerIds": [],
        "state": "CREATED",
        "version": "1.0"
    }
]
```

After creating a non-empty role (as per Test 1.4.1): 

```
[
    {
        "applicationIds": [],
        "id": "emptyrole",
        "name": "EmptyRole",
        "startingResourceIds": [],
        "startingTransducerIds": [],
        "state": "CREATED",
        "version": "1.0"
    },
    {
        "applicationIds": [
            "firefox"
        ],
        "id": "firefox1231546627817",
        "name": "firefox123",
        "startingResourceIds": [],
        "startingTransducerIds": [],
        "state": "CREATED",
        "version": "1.0"
    }
]
```
