## 1.6 - Create and Assign Roles

### Test Description

Using the Admin CLI, create roles for or assign existing roles to a user present in Galahad (step above). Is this intuitive? Verify the user can then login to Canvas and start virtues (not roles).

### Preconditions

- Cloud Formation script has run to completion
- At least one user has been created
- One non-empty role has been created (see Test 1.4 - Create a New Role)

### Steps to Test

- Connect to the Excalibur instance
    - Add key `starlab-virtue-te` to your SSH agent
    - Find the public IP for the `Virtue-XX-Excalibur` instance (where `XX` is your stack suffix) 
    - SSH to the Excalibur instance using PuTTY or a command-line SSH connection as the `ubuntu` user using the above SSH key

- On the Excalibur instance, obtain an auth token for the admin CLI:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        
        python3 sso_login.py -u jmitchell@virtue.com -o token.json -p Test123! -A APP_1 excalibur.galahad.com:5002
        # This will prompt for a password: Test123!
        
        export VIRTUE_ADDRESS=excalibur.galahad.com
        export VIRTUE_TOKEN=`cat token.json`

- Create a role as per #test-1.4---Create-New-Role

### Expected Result

*Describe what we expect to happen, including information about the time it takes for an operation to complete. Describe in terms of what we would see from the command line interface, the blue force tracker, and from the user's perspective.*

### Actual Result

*Describe what actually happens. Record the branch and version (treeish) of the repository you performed the test on. When re-tested after some major code change, add the result at that point to the writeup here. This will record what happens as the codebase evolves.*
