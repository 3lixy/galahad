## 1.7 - Add a New Application to Galahad

### Test Description

Build an app that will eventually be used to create a role. Is this something in Admin CLI or not? If not, does it need to be? Whatâ€™s our plan for this when for the eval?

Note: building an app container is not currently an Admin API task. The process is documented in the `docker-virtue` repository at `virtue/README.md`. Unless the application has a "headless" installation mode, the process cannot be automated.

Warning: The Elastic Container Registry (ECR) that holds all of the application images is currently SHARED across Galahad stacks. If you make a change to a container that someone is using in another Galahad universe, you very well may break their tests. Be careful!

### Preconditions

- This procedure is run on a host that _can_ be on the Galahad VPC, but doesn't need to be. The host needs to have the following services installed:
    - Docker
    - Python 3
    - `docker-compose`
    - `docker-py`
    - git
    - AWS CLI

### Steps to Test

Building an application container and using it in a role requires three steps:

- Build a new container
- Push the new container to the Docker Elastic Container Registry
- Use the admin API to create an application object in LDAP

At this point, the admin can create a new role that uses the application.

#### Build a Linux Application Container

- Determine the installation procedures required for your application. In general, installing from the Ubuntu package manager makes this simpler, but is not required.
- Clone the `docker-virtue` repository:
    - `git clone git@github.com:starlab-io/docker-virtue.git`
- Change directory to the `virtue` subdirectory
- Edit the `VirtueDockerConf.yaml` file to add your application:
    - Under the `containers` key, add a section for your new application of the form (where user-supplied values are in `<>`:

            <my-application>:
                image_tag: virtue-<application-id>
                ssh_port: <some-unused-number>
                apparmor: None
                seccomp: None

      Note that this initial setting will run _without_ apparmor or seccomp profiles specific to the application being added. They will use the default Docker profiles for both, but the application can be locked down further by creating custom profiles for the new application.

    - Under the `image_tags` section, add a key that matches the `image_tag` specified above, with a `base_image_tag` subkey. This can usually be `virtue-base` for Linux applications. (While the tag name implies that this image will be built on top of the given tag, it is more of a note to the build system that it is a build prerequisite so that the system can build the containers in the right order.)

            virtue-<application_id>:
                base_image_tag: virtue-base

- Add a Dockerfile for the new application:
    - `cd app-containers`
    - `cp Dockerfile.TEMPLATE Dockerfile.virtue-<application_id>`
- Modify the Dockerfile as per one of the scenarios below.
- Build the individual Docker image by running `python3 ./build.py <image-tag>` where `<image-tag>` is the one you need for your application. If this completes successfully, you have managed to build your image file.

##### Installing from a Package

If the application to be used is available through a package manager, the easiest way to do this is to add the appropriate commands to the Dockerfile, as per the snippet below, replacing `<PUT_YOUR_PACKAGES_HERE>` with the appropriate list of `apt` packages your application requires.

```
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -qy install <PUT_YOUR_PACKAGES_HERE> && \
    apt-get autoremove -y && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists* /tmp/* /var/tmp/*
```

For example, to install GEdit, you would replace the placeholder with `gedit`, which is the apt package name for the GEdit software. If you need to install more than one package, list them all in the same command, separated by spaces.

Next, replace `<COMMAND_TO_RUN>` with the command that should be run in the XPRA session. For the GEdit example, the command is `gedit`. For other applications, this may be more complex.

Also replace `<PORT_YOU_SPECIFIED>` with the port number you provided in the `VirtueDockerConf.yaml` file. 

Save the Dockerfile.

##### Installing from a headless installer

First, add any required prerequisites to the `apt install` `RUN` command. If you don't need any additional packages, you can delete the entire `RUN` block with apt commands in it.

If the installer is available online:

- Add a RUN command that downloads, extracts, and runs the installer:

        RUN wget https://example.com/downloads/application.tgz && \
            tar -zxf application.tgz && \
            cd application && \
            ./install.sh --some_option=aValue

- Replace the `<COMMAND_TO_RUN>` placeholder with the command to run, relative to the `/home/virtue` directory.

If the installer is available locally to the machine you're running on:

- Add a `COPY` line to the Dockerfile to copy your installer over to the Dockerfile, and then a `RUN` line to install it:

        COPY /path/to/application.tgz /tmp/
        RUN cd /tmp && tar -zxf application.tgz && cd application && ./install.sh

  Note that this assumes that the application file is accessible during the build process. This will NOT work in the Jenkins automated build environment unless you do some special work to make the installer file available there.
- Replace the `<COMMAND_TO_RUN>` placeholder with the right command, relative to the `/home/virtue` directory.

#### Build a Windows Application Container

To create a new Crossover-based Virtue:

- Set the test key as the default public key to access the temporary Virtue: `export SSHPUBKEY=$(cat virtue-test-key.pub)` 
- Launch a Crossover cxsetup bottle running on port 7000: `./virtue start Virtue-cxsetup.config` 
- Load the SSH key: `ssh-add virtue-test-key` 
- Set up an SSH tunnel to XPRA in the container. If successful, this will have no terminal output. `ssh -N -p 7000 -L 7001:localhost:2023 virtue@localhost`
- In a new terminal window: `xpra attach tcp:localhost:7001` to open the XPRA window, which should be showing the Crossover Setup window
- Install the software into a new bottle using the Crossover interface
- On the final installation screen, make sure to select "Advanced Installation Options" and copy the list of dependencies to be installed to another file.
- Export the PuTTY Bottle as a Bottle Archive:
    - In the cxsetup window, click the picture of the bottles in the top left to list the app bottles Crossover knows about
    - Right click on the app bottle and select "Export Bottle to Archive"
    - Pick a file location you can remember (I suggest /home/virtue) and hit OK
    - This will take a few minutes
- Copy the .cxarchive file out of the container to the host: `docker cp container_name:/home/virtue/myapp.cxarchive app-containers/myapp.cxarchive`
- Build a new Dockerfile that installs the prereqs (listed under "Advanced" when you installed the app in Crossover), copies in the cxarchive file, and then decompresses it. See `Dockerfile.virtue-putty` for an example.
- Add your app to `VirtueContainerConfig.yaml`, as above

At this point, you need a handful of files from external sources:

- `cxlicense.sig`: License files for CrossOver
- `cxlicense.txt`: License files for CrossOver
- `cxoffice-overlay.tgz`: Modified version of WINE, available in Jenkins at http://35.170.157.4:8080/view/all/job/virtue-wine/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/cxoffice-overlay.tgz
- `install_overlay.py`: Available in Jenkins at http://35.170.157.4:8080/view/all/job/virtue-wine/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/install_overlay.py

Once you've got those files copied into the `app-containers` directory, you can run `./build.py virtue-<application-id>` and it should complete.

#### Update Galahad to use the application

- After running `./build.py`, you will see a log message containing a docker container name that looks something like this:
        
        Building app-containers/Dockerfile.virtue-putty as 703915126451.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/starlab-virtue:virtue-putty ... [OK]
                                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Copy the portion underlined above, as you'll need it in a minute.
- Push the image to the Galahad Elastic Container Registry (ECR):
    - Log in to the ECR with the AWS console: `$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-2)`
    - Push the container: `docker push <container-name-from-above>`

#### Create an Application object for the new application

- Connect to the Excalibur instance
    - Add key `starlab-virtue-te` to your SSH agent
    - Find the public IP for the `Virtue-XX-Excalibur` instance (where `XX` is your stack suffix) 
    - SSH to the Excalibur instance using PuTTY or a command-line SSH connection as the `ubuntu` user using the above SSH key

- On the Excalibur instance, obtain an auth token for the admin CLI:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        
        python3 sso_login.py -u jmitchell@virtue.com -o token.json -p Test123! -A APP_1 excalibur.galahad.com:5002
        
        export VIRTUE_ADDRESS=excalibur.galahad.com
        export VIRTUE_TOKEN=`cat token.json`

- Use the `virtue-admin` script to add the new application to the system:

        ./virtue-admin application add --applicationInfo=my-new-app.json
  where the file `my-new-app.json` looks like this:

        {
            "id": "application-id-from-above",
            "name": "User Friendly Name for Application",
            "os": "LINUX or WINDOWS",
            "port": "port-from-above",
            "version": "some-version-identifier"
        }
- Use the `application list` command to verify that it was added correctly.

        ./virtue-admin application list

#### Create a role that uses the application and test

Create a role as per in the instructions in Test 1.04, using the application ID defined above. Authorize a user for the role as per the instructions in Test 1.06. This should allow the user to use the new application when they log in through Canvas.

### Expected Result

After following the steps above, we expect to see the new application in the list of available applications, the new role able to be assigned to a user, and the user able to access the application.

### Actual Result

#### 8f49db13a7e64608bbfc677f8e0ffd21b092865d

*Tested 1/21/2019 by Alex Jordan*

As of this revision, the application container can be created and pushed to the Docker Elastic Container Registry (ECR). However, the `application add` command is not available through the administrator API, so we cannot test that process. We can work around this by performing the LDAP insertion locally, but I'm going to mark the test as fail until the process works as described above.
