## 1.8 - Start and Stop a Virtue

### Test Description

Using the Admin CLI, stop a given userâ€™s virtue.

Also tests the start of a virtue.

### Preconditions

Cloud Formation script has run to completion.

### Steps to Test

- Connect to the Excalibur instance
    - Add key `starlab-virtue-te` to your SSH agent
    - Find the public IP for the `Virtue-XX-Excalibur` instance (where `XX` is your stack suffix) 
    - SSH to the Excalibur instance using PuTTY or a command-line SSH connection as the `ubuntu` user using the above SSH key
- On the Excalibur instance, obtain an auth token for the admin CLI:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        
        python3 sso_login.py -u jmitchell@virtue.com -o token.json -p Test123! -A APP_1 excalibur.galahad.com:5002
        # This will prompt for a password: Test123!
        
        export VIRTUE_ADDRESS=excalibur.galahad.com
        export VIRTUE_TOKEN=`cat token.json`
        
### Start (Create/Launch) a Virtue        

- Verify at least one valor exists. If not, follow steps in test 1.1 to create a valor.

- Verify the firefox123 role has been created (test 1.2). If not, follow steps in test 1.4.

- Verify at least one user exists (test 1.3). If not, follow steps in test 1.5.

- Use the admin CLI to authorize a user for the firefox123 role:

        ./virtue-admin user role authorize --username=<username> --roleId=<firefox123 role id>

- Use the admin CLI to create a new virtue:

        ./virtue-admin virtue create --username=<username> --roleId=<firefox123 role id>

- Use the admin CLI to list the virtues and wait for the state to transition from CREATING to STOPPED:

        ./virtue-admin user virtue list --username=<username>

- Use the admin CLI to launch the just created virtue:

        ./virtue virtue launch --virtueId=<virtue id>

- Use the admin CLI to list the virtues and confirm the state is RUNNING:

        ./virtue-admin user virtue list --username=<username>

### Stop a Virtue

- Use the user API to stop a running virtue:

        ./virtue virtue stop --virtueId=<virtueId>

- Use the user API to verify the virtue state is STOPPED:

        ./virtue virtue get --virtueId=<virtueId>

- Use the user API to re-launch the stopped virtue:

        ./virtue virtue launch --virtueId=<virtueId>


### Expected Result

For each user, you should see an entry like this:

```json
{
    "authorizedRoleIds": [ "role_id_1", ..., "role_id_n"],
    "username": "some.username"
}
```

After confirming a user and the firefox123 role exist. The API call to add the user role authorization should return the following:

```json
{
    "result": [
        0,
        "Successfully completed operation."
    ],
    "status": "success"
}

```
The creation of the new virtue should have a response of the following form:

```json
{
    "id": "Virtue_firefox123_1548188921",
    "ipAddress": "NULL"
}

```
While creating the virtue (which takes a while, 10 - 20 seconds) the virtue list should return something of the following form:

```json
[
    {
        "applicationIds": [],
        "id": "Virtue_firefox123_1548188921",
        "ipAddress": "10.91.0.3",
        "resourceIds": [],
        "roleId": "firefox1231548186134",
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "transducerIds": [],
        "username": "jmitchell"
    },
    {
        "applicationIds": [],
        "id": "Virtue_wincmd456_1548191058",
        "ipAddress": "NULL",
        "resourceIds": [],
        "roleId": "wincmd4561548186263",
        "state": "CREATING",
        "transducerIds": [],
        "username": "jmitchell"
    }
]

```

After the virtue is created, the state will become STOPPED.

The response to the launch should be:

```json
./virtue virtue launch --virtueId=<Virtue ID>
{
    "result": [
        0,
        "Successfully completed operation."
    ],
    "status": "success"
}

```
Virtue list after successful launch (state is RUNNING):

```json
./virtue-admin user virtue list --username=<username>[
    {
        "applicationIds": [],
        "id": "Virtue_firefox123_1548188921",
        "ipAddress": "10.91.0.3",
        "resourceIds": [],
        "roleId": "firefox1231548186134",
        "state": "RUNNING",
        "transducerIds": [],
        "username": "jmitchell"
    }
]

```
After stopping the virtue, you should see an entry like this:

```json
{
    "result": [
        0,
        "Successfully completed operation."
    ],
    "status": "success"
}

```
Getting the virtue details should show its state as STOPPED:

```json
{
    "applicationIds": [],
    "id": "Virtue_firefox123_1546984484",
    "ipAddress": "10.91.0.2",
    "resourceIds": [],
    "roleId": "firefox1231546885862",
    "state": "STOPPED",
    "transducerIds": [],
    "username": "jmitchell"
}

```
After re-launching the virtue, you should see an entry like this (Takes several seconds):

```json
{
    "result": [
        0,
        "Successfully completed operation."
    ],
    "status": "success"
}

```
