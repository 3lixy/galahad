## 1.1 - Deploy Valors

### Test Description

With Galahad ‘cloud-formed’, deploy a collection of valors. Do some scalability testing and get a sense of performance, i.e., time to deploy, do all valors show up on BFT, etc.

### Preconditions

- Cloud Formation script has run to completion
- At least one administrative user has been created as part of the cloud formation process

### Steps to Test

- Connect to the Excalibur instance
    - Add key `starlab-virtue-te` to your SSH agent
    - Find the public IP for the `Virtue-XX-Excalibur` instance (where `XX` is your stack suffix) 
    - SSH to the Excalibur instance using PuTTY or a command-line SSH connection as the `ubuntu` user using the above SSH key
    - For this connection, add a port forwarding rule to forward port 3000 locally to 3000 on the Excalibur instance. This will let you access the Blue Force Tracker
        - On the command line, this can be done by adding `-L 3000:127.0.0.1:3000` to the SSH command you use to connect
        - In PuTTY, change the SSH settings under `Connection` > `SSH` > `Tunnels`. Use `3000` for Source Port and `127.0.0.1:3000` for Destination, and then click the `Add` button.

- On the Excalibur instance, set up the environment for the admin CLI. Note that you will need to do this for each terminal in which you want to run the admin CLI.

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        source set_virtue_environment.sh jmitchell Test123!
        
- Run the `valor create` command to allocate and configure a valor:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli
        ./virtue-admin valor create
  This will take a while, as it does not return until the command completes, and the command itself spins up an EC2 instance. This can take between 5 and 10 minutes. The command should return a JSON object with a `valor_id` key with a value that starts with `i-` (this is the EC2 instance ID).

- Run `valor list` and verify that the `valor_id` returned in the previous step is present in the list:

        ./virtue-admin valor list

- Run `valor launch` to start the valor instance:

        ./virtue-admin valor launch --valor_id=<valor_id>
  This takes a while too (approx. 3-4 minutes), as it involves starting the EC2 instance.

- Check to see if the Valors show up in the Blue Force Tracker:
    - Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/
    - Click on the Valors link in the left pane
    - You should see a bar chart and a table, with a chart column and a table row for each Valor

### Expected Result

When running `valor create`:

```
$ ./virtue-admin valor create
{
    "valor_id": "some-valor-id"
}
```

Note that this will take a while - maybe as long as 8-10 minutes.

When running `valor list`:

```
$ ./virtue-admin valor list
[
    ...
    {
        "address": "some-ip-address",
        "function": "valor",
        "guestnet": "some-net-address",
        "id": "some-uuid",
        "valor_id": "some-valor-id-same-as-above"
    }
    ...
]
```

When running `valor launch`:

```
$ ./virtue-admin valor launch --valor_id=some-valor-id-from-above
{
    "valor_id": "some-valor-id-from-above"
}
```

Note that this will take a few minutes.

In the Blue Force Tracker, you should see all of the valors returned in the `valor list` command in the table.

During the test, I was able to verify that all of the Valors appear in the BFT's Valor table. The Valor appears some time during the middle of the creation process, and do not need to be launched in order to show up in the table.
