## Set Logging Configuration For Single Virtue and Valor

### Test Description

Using the Admin CLI, change the logging configuration for a single valor and virtue. Can the Admin get a list of configurations that can be changed to help inform his decision?

Note that we are declaring the sensor subset of transducers to be part of logging here.

### Preconditions

- Cloud formation has run to completion

### Steps to Test

- Connect to the Excalibur instance
    - Add key `starlab-virtue-te` to your SSH agent
    - Find the public IP for the `Virtue-XX-Excalibur` instance (where `XX` is your stack suffix)
    - SSH to the Excalibur instance using PuTTY or a command-line SSH connection as the `ubuntu` user using the above SSH key

- On the Excalibur instance, obtain an auth token for the admin CLI:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalibur/cli

        python3 sso_login.py -u jmitchell@virtue.com -o token.json -p Test123! -A APP_1 excalibur.galahad.com:5002
        # This will prompt for a password: Test123!

        export VIRTUE_ADDRESS=excalibur.galahad.com
        export VIRTUE_TOKEN=`cat token.json`

- Use the `virtue-admin` CLI to list available applications:

        cd /home/ubuntu/galahad/excalbur/cli
        ./virtue-admin application list

- Next, create a role (You can skip this step if you created a role in test 1.04)

		# Create a role file for a Firefox User role. Should look something like this:
        #  {
        #    "name": "firefox123",
        #    "version": "1.0",
        #    "applicationIds": ["firefox"],
        #    "startingResourceIds": [],
        #    "startingTransducerIds": []
        #  }
        vim firefox.role

        # Create the role (this will take 15-20 minutes)
        ./virtue-admin role create --role=firefox.role --unitySize=4GB

        # Poll the role list until the role shows up with a status of CREATED
        # You'll need to record the roleId for later steps.
        ./virtue-admin role list


- Next, create a virtue from this new role

		./virtue-admin virtue create username=jmitchell roleId=$ROLE_ID_FROM_ABOVE

This will produce something like the following:

		{
		    "id": "Virtue_firefox123_1546984484",
		    "ipAddress": "NULL"
		}


- Now, we proceed to attempt to change the logging configuration of this newly made virtue.  First, lets list all of our transducers:

		./virtue-security transducer list

And then list the currently enabled transducers for our virtue:

		./virtue-security transducer list enabled virtueId=$VIRTUE_ID_FROM_ABOVE$

This should be empty, like below:

		Virtue ID: Virtue_firefox123_1546984484
		------------------
		[]
		------------------

- Next, we enable one of the possible transducers (sensors).

		# Create an empty config
		{}

		vim empty_config.json

		./virtue-security transducer enable --transducerId=open_fd --virtueId=$VIRTUE_ID_FROM_ABOVE$ --configuration=empty_config.json

And recheck our transducer state for this virtue

		./virtue-security transducer list enabled --virtueId=$VIRTUE_ID_FROM_ABOVE$

- Next, we disable this same transducer (sensor) and check our state

		./virtue-security transducer disable --transducerId=open_fd --virtueId=$VIRTUE_ID_FROM_ABOVE$
		./virtue-security transducer list enabled --virtueId=$VIRTUE_ID_FROM_ABOVE$

        # LIST VALOR SECURITY STATE

        -- NOT IMPLEMENTED --

        # SET MIGRATION TIME, INTROSPECTION CONFIG FOR VALOR

        -- NOT IMPLEMENTED --



### Expected Result

When listing all possible transducers, we should expect a (potentially long) list of transducer options, something like this:

```json
	[
	    {
	        "id": "path_mkdir",
	        "name": "Directory Creation",
	        "requiredAccess": [],
	        "startEnabled": "True",
	        "startingConfiguration": "{}",
	        "type": "SENSOR"
	    },
	   ...
	]
```

When getting the list of enabled transducers for a virtue with none enabled, this should be an empty list:

```json
	[]
```

And for listing enabled transducers, a list with some number of transducer names should exist:

```json
	[
    	"open_fd"
	]
```


Calling transducer enable should add to this list, and transducer disable should decrement from it.  

### Actual Result

#### f712e274d68ceb63c6b08b32ba8bab700d968430 - Update test reports for 1.2, 1.4

Listing Transducers:

```json
	[
	    {
	        "id": "path_mkdir",
	        "name": "Directory Creation",
	        "requiredAccess": [],
	        "startEnabled": "True",
	        "startingConfiguration": "{}",
	        "type": "SENSOR"
	    },
	   ...
	]
```

Listing enabled transducers (sensor) before adding any:

```json
	[]
```

Enabling a transducer (sensor) on our virtue:

```json
	{
	    "result": [
	        0,
	        "Successfully completed operation."
	    ],
	    "status": "success"
	}
```

Then, rechecking our enabled transducers on our virtue:

```json
	[
    	"open_fd"
	]
```

Disabling our transducer (sensor):

```json
	{
    "result": [
        0,
        "Successfully completed operation."
    ],
    "status": "success"
	}
```

And rechecking our list of enabled transducers:

```json
	[]
```

Capability for changing logging for valors does not currently exist via the CLI/tooling, so these protions of the test fail.
