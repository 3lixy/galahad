## On User Disconnect

### Test Description

Virtues with no apps interacting with the user are stopped, paused, destroyed??

### Preconditions

Cloudformation has finished running.  A role and virtue has been created and assigned to the user, as described in tests 1.4, 1.6, and 2.2.  This includes creating the firefox123 role and assigning it to user jmitchell.  

### Steps to Test

Sign into canvas as jmitchell, as described in the canvas_user_guide.md in this directory.  

Open the firefox application in the firefox123 role.  Should the box that opens stay orange, something is wrong; see the Canvas user guide for debugging details.

Close the app, and exit Canvas.  Use the CLI or ssh directly into the Valor to assess the state of the virtue.  For the CLI (See any security/admin CLI test for setup details), run:

	./virtue-admin user virtue list --username=jmitchell

And assess the state of the virtue in question.  Output should resemble

```json
	[
	    {
	        "applicationIds": [],
	        "id": "Virtue_firefox123_1546984484",
	        "ipAddress": "10.91.0.2",
	        "resourceIds": [],
	        "roleId": "firefox1231546885862",
	        "state": "RUNNING",
	        "transducerIds": [],
	        "username": "jmitchell"
	    }
	]
```

### Expected Result

We expect on user disconnect from Canvas for the Virtue state to change from "RUNNING" to some non-running state.  

### Actual Result

#### 8f49db13a7e64608bbfc677f8e0ffd21b092865d - Add test report for 1.3 

After exiting Canvas and closing the firefox app, we find the following virtue state:

```json
	[
	    {
	        "applicationIds": [],
	        "id": "Virtue_firefox123_1546984484",
	        "ipAddress": "10.91.0.2",
	        "resourceIds": [],
	        "roleId": "firefox1231546885862",
	        "state": "RUNNING",
	        "transducerIds": [],
	        "username": "jmitchell"
	    }
	]
```

The virtue does not shut down or pause.  This is failing behavior.
